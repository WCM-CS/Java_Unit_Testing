# Java_Unit_Testing

The tests are created with Java JUnit testing and Assertions are the main driver of the test cases. 

These three unit tests were generated on separate weeks. Note the progression from the first class ContactService which included slightly redundant practices such as multiple arrays for shared elements. Task and appointment classes are much cleaner, have better functionality, and their test cases are of a slightly higher coverage rate.
